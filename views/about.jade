  h3 Meetings
  p
  | The coworking space "Bottfabrik" is open all day. If you want to talk to people before the talks start, get there at 19:00.
  | The first talk then starts at 19:30. We aim for 20 minute talks, with Q&A afterwards. We also have open discussion that can take a while longer.

  p
  | Afterwards everyone is welcome to stay, have a beer (or whatever beverage you prefer,
  | they're provided for a small fee in a big fridge) and talk to attendees. In short: beer.js!

  h3 Speakers
  p
  | We're looking for two talks every month, and while some speakers come back, new speakers are always needed and welcome.
  | In general a small meetup like this is a great way to get started with doing conference talks.

  h3 Location
  p
  | We meet at the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/is9rS">coworking space "Bottfabrik"</a> in the southern part of Cologne (SÃ¼dstadt).
  | It is best to get there with public transport, just hop onto Line 15, 16 or 18 and get off at "Ubierring".
  | You can also get there by car (an underground parking is right across the street at Agrippinawerft), but it's quite expensive and not really recommended.
