		# About

		## Meetings

		We meet at cowoco, which is open all day. If you want to talk to people before the talks start, get there at 19:30. The first talk then starts at 20:00. We aim for 20 minute talks, with Q&A afterwards. We also have open discussion that can take a while longer.

		Afterwards everyone is welcome to stay, have a beer (or whatever beverage you prefer, they're provided by cowoco for a small fee in a big fridge) and talk to attendees. In short: beer.js!

		## Speakers

		We're looking for two talks every month, and while some speakers come back, new speakers are always needed and welcome. In general a small meetup like this is a great way to get started with doing conference talks.

		## Location

		Cowoco is in Köln-Deutz. Not exactly downtown (aka Innenstadt), or hip Ehrenfeld, but its pretty easy to reach nonetheless! If you're coming by train, go to Bahnhof Köln Messe/Deutz, then walk up Deutz-Mülheimer Straße. If you're coming by car, tune your GPS for [Deutz-Mülheimer Straße 129 51063 Köln](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=Gasmotorenfabrik,+Deutz-M%C3%BClheimer+Stra%C3%9Fe+129,+51063+K%C3%B6ln). Parking space is usually easy to find (unless there's a lot of construction going on), but even then you should find a spot at Kunstwerk/Gebäude 9 (to the left of Cowoco).
