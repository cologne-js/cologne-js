  h1 About Cologne.js

  h3 Meetings
  p
  | We meet at CowoCo, which is open all day. If you want to talk to people before the talks start, get there at 19:30.
  | The first talk then starts at 20:00. We aim for 20 minute talks, with Q&A afterwards. We also have open discussion that can take a while longer.

  p
  | Afterwards everyone is welcome to stay, have a beer (or whatever beverage you prefer,
  | they're provided by cowoco for a small fee in a big fridge) and talk to attendees. In short: beer.js!

  h3 Speakers
  p
  | We're looking for two talks every month, and while some speakers come back, new speakers are always needed and welcome.
  | In general a small meetup like this is a great way to get started with doing conference talks.

  h3 Location
  p
  | CowoCo is in Köln-Deutz. Not exactly downtown (aka Innenstadt), or hip Ehrenfeld, but its pretty easy to reach nonetheless!
  ul
    li If you're coming by train, go to Bahnhof Köln Messe/Deutz. By tram take the lines 3 or 4 and hop off at "koelnmesse". Then walk up Deutz-Mülheimer Straße (approx. 5-10 minutes).
    li If you're coming by car, tune your GPS for <a href="https://maps.google.de/maps?q=Gasmotorenfabrik,+Deutz-M%C3%BClheimer+Stra%C3%9Fe+129,+51063+K%C3%B6ln">Deutz-Mülheimer Straße 129, 51063 Köln</a>.
  p Parking space is usually easy to find (unless there's a lot of construction going on), but even then you should find a spot at Kunstwerk/Gebäude 9 (to the left of CowoCo).
