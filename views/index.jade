          ##### Public transport
          Hop onto line 9, 12 or 15 and get off at Zülpicher Platz.
          The location is around 80 m down the street.

          <!--
          ##### By car (not really recommended)
          You can try the parking lot in front of the [University of Applied Sciences](http://goo.gl/maps/7TER4)
          at this time (4€ for the whole evening) or use the underground parking just around the corner at
          Agrippinawerft, but it's quite expensive. :(
