          **50678 Köln**

          ##### Public transport
          Hop onto line 15 or 16 or take the bus 106 and get off at Ubierring.
          Or take bus 132, 133 or 142 and exit at Chlodwigsplatz.

          ##### By car (not really recommended)
          You can try the parking lot in front of the [University of Applied Sciences](http://goo.gl/maps/7TER4)
          at this time (4€ for the whole evening) or use the underground parking just around the corner at
          Agrippinawerft, but it's quite expensive. :(
