  description: |
    In this talk I'll cover several patterns for maintainability and performance,
    giving some new perspectives on the library we all seem to know so well.</p>
    <p>Topics include: how to use event delegation for just in time
    initialization; how to structure your markup, CSS and JS for them to work
    well together while promoting maintainability of all three; how to avoid
    performance bottlenecks when using jQuery; how to use CSS3 transitions
    with fallbacks; and finally, how to reuse existing widgets with unique
    look and feel.
