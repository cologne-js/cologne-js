  title: "Effective jQuery"
  description: |
    In this talk I'll cover several patterns for maintainability and performance,
    giving some new perspectives on the library we all seem to know so well.</p>
    <p>Topics include: how to use event delegation for just in time
    initialization; how to structure your markup, CSS and JS for them to work
    well together while promoting maintainability of all three; how to avoid
    performance bottlenecks when using jQuery; how to use CSS3 transitions
    with fallbacks; and finally, how to reuse existing widgets with unique
    look and feel.

  title: "Tales from the crypt: JavaScript & the Internet of Things"
  description: |
    We reverse engineer one of the most used "closed source consumer electronics
    homeautomation protocols" (say that 5 times in a row) and build a JavaScript
    based open source module for it. Using that module we´re then able to control
    the privacy of our data (because now we truly own it), combine these former
    vendor locked in devices with DIY components, control that devices from our
    own browser app (our goodbye to the world of "IPhone Apps of Things") and as
    a byproduct explain why JavaScript should be the language of choice for this
    "IoT" thingy.
