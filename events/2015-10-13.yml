  title: "Creating and documenting APIs with Hapi and Swagger"
  description: |
    When you start creating a new API, sooner or later the question arises,
    how to document it for yourself and for your end users.
    Wouldn't it be nice, if the documentation always stays in sync with your code automatically?
    And if your end users could use it as well to explore your API?
    </p><p>
    Hapi offers a great foundation to develop RESTful APIs in Node.js,
    while Swagger is the ideal counterpart to document your work.
    Frederic will give you a short introduction to Hapi and how you can use Swagger
    to create always up-to-date documentation with almost no effort.

  title: "Microservice-based software architecture"
  description: |
    Following the classical software architecture patterns we tend to design large monolith of software applications. 
    These monoliths are typically quite difficult to scale as they often require powerful machines, making the option to scale out very expensive. 
    In most cases these monoliths of software are designed to run on a single machine only, hence scaling out is complicated or even impossible without refactoring large portions of the application. 
    Therefore a new design pattern called microservices arose. 
    The pattern of microservices keeps the need of a clustered server setup in mind and helps to keep the application very modular. 
    This allows to simplify a scale out of your application and even allows to scale the bottlenecks of your application only and hence reducing the total cost for a scale out approach. 
    In this talk I will introduce the concept of microservices, how they are defined and how to design an application with them. 
    Furthermore I will show how to scale the application properly and why this is only possible due to the use of microservices. 
    Also we will have a look at Node.js and why it is a perfect, though not the only, fit to this design strategy. 
    However scaling is not the only purpose of microservices, they also increase the flexibility and maintainability of applications, this will also be discussed in the talk.
