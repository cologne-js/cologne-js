  title: "Talk To Me - Making web sites accessible"
  description: "A computer that can talk to us has been part of science fiction for a long time. For those with limited or no sight at all it has been a reality for a while. It's this group that often benefits the most from the web, since it can give them a form of independence they might not have in their day to day life. This talk will cover: Arguments to convince your boss of the value of making web sites accessible; Software to work with and test against; Examples of the challenges and how to overcome them with JavaScript."
