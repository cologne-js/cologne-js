  title: "Introduction to hybrid mobile app development"
  description: |
    Development of mobile apps is not easy, and each target platform has its own
    tools and requirements. This may be Java and Eclipse for Android, Objective-C
    and XCode for iOS or the Microsoft tools for Windows Phone.
    This talk will introduce you to developing apps for all major platforms with
    only HTML5 and JavaScript. We're starting with Intel's free XDK and Apache
    Cordova, then go into details concerning the most important frameworks and
    development approaches to help you becoming a succesfull cross-platform
    developer.
