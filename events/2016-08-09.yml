  title: "Next Generation NoSQL: Multi Model Databases"
  description: |
    The recent progress in the database development has lead us a long and winding road:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Using relational for everything</li>
      <li>NoSQL and polyglot persistence: Introducing a ton of different technologies to learn</li>
      <li>Next wave: Multi Model databases and polyglot data</li>
    </ul>
    In this talk we will see the pros and cons of each of these stations.
    Also we will have a more in-depth introduction to Multi Model Databases and why they are the next step in database evolution.
    Finally we will talk about big data requirements and how they fit into this landscape of database technologies.
    How can we scale and run databases in production?
    We are using a whole cluster of machines, collecting and mining terabytes of data with ease.
