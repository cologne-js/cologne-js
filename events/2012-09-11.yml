  description: "Nowadays frontend developers have to deal with topics and tools that they’ve never encountered before: unit testing, code linting, minification, code modularization and more.\n\n\
    Those who’ve done it, know that setting everything up and maintaining it is a pain that costs hours of working time.
    But that’s not true anymore: thanks to Grunt, we now have a frontend specific build tool that eliminates most of the hard work.\n\n\
    During this talk we will learn how to setup grunt, learn to use it in a real world project and discover it’s ecosystem of plugins."
