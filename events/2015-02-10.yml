  title: "hapi – Building apps and services in Node.js"
  description: |
    hapi is a framework for building web applications, services and RESTful APIs
    in Node.js. Besides being the core building block for Walmart's mobile
    platform, it also powers the new npm website and many others.</p><p>
    Frederic gives a short introduction and explains the core concepts and
    different approaches compared to other frameworks.

  title: "Effective jQuery (Speaker is ill)"
  description: |
    In this talk I'll cover several patterns for maintainability and performance,
    giving some new perspectives on the library we all seem to know so well.</p>
    <p>Topics include: how to use event delegation for just in time
    initialization; how to structure your markup, CSS and JS for them to work
    well together while promoting maintainability of all three; how to avoid
    performance bottlenecks when using jQuery; how to use CSS3 transitions
    with fallbacks; and finally, how to reuse existing widgets with unique
    look and feel.

  title: "Replacement: Microservice-based software architecture"
  description: |
    Following the classical software architecture patterns we tend to design large monolith of software applications.
    These monoliths are typically quite difficult to scale as they often require powerful machines, making the option to scale out very expensive.
    In most cases these monoliths of software are designed to run on a single machine only, hence scaling out is complicated or even impossible without refactoring large portions of the application.
    Therefore a new design pattern called microservices arose.
    The pattern of microservices keeps the need of a clustered server setup in mind and helps to keep the application very modular.
    This allows to simplify a scale out of your application and even allows to scale the bottlenecks of your application only and hence reducing the total cost for a scale out approach.
    In this talk I will introduce the concept of microservices, how they are defined and how to design an application with them.
    Furthermore I will show how to scale the application properly and why this is only possible due to the use of microservices.
    Also we will have a look at Node.js and why it is a perfect, though not the only, fit to this design strategy.
    However scaling is not the only purpose of microservices, they also increase the flexibility and maintainability of applications, this will also be discussed in the talk.
