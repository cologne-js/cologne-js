  title: "Replacement: Progressive enhancement in practice"
  description: |
    The web is constantly growing. In terms of underlying technologies, variety of connected devices and last but not least its worldwide users. This growth is a real challenge when it comes to developing modern web applications. Common requirements in these projects are: Establish a codebase that is maintainable, modular and reusable; keep up with new technologies and standards; and deliver new features to a maximum of users without breaking the whole application.
    This talk points out that these conflicting goals can actually be fulfilled with the help of progressive enhancement – a founding principle of the web in which base technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript are safely layered on top of each other. The given examples help to understand how this principle works in practice and show how to build robust but interactive and future-friendly web applications.
