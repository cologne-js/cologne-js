    Ho Ho Ho â€“ Winter is coming and so is our next meetup. Cologne.js has a special for you:
    This time we want to talk about your projects, hacks and ideas.
    Do you want to start a new project and need some feedback, help or inspiration?
    Have you come across a new incredible library or framework and can't wait to show it to your fellow nerds?
    Or would you just like to discover what others are up to?
    Everybody who wants to contribute and any topic is welcome. There will be loads of time to chat and no question will go unanswered.We are happy to see you on Tuesday, the 13th of December.
