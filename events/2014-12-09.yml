  description: |
      I'd like to talk about time series data(bases) in general and InfluxDB in particular.
      Since InfluxDB has a HTTP-based API and talks JSON, we can use it directly from
      Browsers/JavaScript to track events, logs, … or to query data back out e.g. for visualization.

      <strong>One team – one language</strong></p>
      <p>Building a multiplatform solution with a small team can be a real challenge. To avoid Babylonian confusion, we decided to only use one language for our entire platform, including webapp, backend and mobile app. We would like to share our motivation, experiences and challenges with you.
