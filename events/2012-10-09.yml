  title: "Introduction to Deferreds and Callbacks"
  description: "Does your code start to look like Christopher Nolan’s Inception? Do you have a hard time following the logic of your own code with callbacks within callbacks within callbacks? Does it become increasingly difficult to maintain and refactor your code because everything is so insanely coupled? It’s probably time to use jQuery’s Deferred and Callbacks objects."

  title: "Accessible JavaScript - a short walkthrough"
  description: "Accessible JavaScript should be in strategic focus from the very first - unfortunately most JavaScript plugins and frameworks don’t. In a short walkthrough we test bad and good examples on accessibility, i.e. if they are usable with keyboard and screenreader. Finally we talk about the use of WAI-ARIA to get JavaScript more accessible."
