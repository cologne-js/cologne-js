  title: "Unhosted & Remote Storage – freedom from the web’s monopolies"
  description: "Web apps are a package deal: You use their app, they get your data. With the Unhosted movement we aim to protect people’s privacy, make it easier to run apps and enable you to have your data in one place. This is achieved by separating apps into client-side apps and per-user data storage, for which we define the open Remotestorage standard."
