  description: "Testing webpages is the inglorious bastard of our time. After we tamed this beast called 'Unit testing' it is now time to shift our frontlines to another topic. This times it`s all about your UI. And no, we`re not going to penetrate our old enemy Selenium, no we're not fighting in the ruby-ish fields of Watir, no my friends, this time it's JavaScripts move to exterminate your bugs once and for all."

  title: "Having fun with graphs"
  description: "This talk is all about drawing on your webpage. We will have a short introduction to d3.js, a library to easily create SVGs in your webpage. Along the way we will render graphs using different layouting strategies. But what are the problems when displaying a graph? Just think of graphs having more vertices then you have pixels on your screen. Or what if you want a user to manupilate the graph and his changes being persistent? Michael will present his answers to this questions, ending up wit a GUI for a graph database."
