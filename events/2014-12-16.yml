  title: InfluxDB
  description: |
      I'd like to talk about time series data(bases) in general and InfluxDB in particular.
      Since InfluxDB has a HTTP-based API and talks JSON, we can use it directly from
      Browsers/JavaScript to track events, logs, â€¦ or to query data back out e.g. for visualization.
