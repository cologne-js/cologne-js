  title: "NativeScript"
  description: |
   NativeScript is a framework for building native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and CSS.
   NativeScript renders UIs with the native platformâ€™s rendering engine, no WebViews, resulting in native-like
   performance and UX. Join me if you're interested in understanding how it works and what differentiates NativeScript
   from technologies with similar goals. The talk will be 40% conceptual and 60% live coding.
