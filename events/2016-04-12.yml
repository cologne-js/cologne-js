  title: "NativeScript"
  description: |
   NativeScript is a framework for building native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and CSS.
   NativeScript renders UIs with the native platformâ€™s rendering engine, no WebViews, resulting in native-like
   performance and UX. Join me if you're interested in understanding how it works and what differentiates NativeScript
   from technologies with similar goals. The talk will be 40% conceptual and 60% live coding.

  title: "Elm as an alternative for frontend development?"
  description: |
   Elm advertises itself as "the best of functional programming in your browser". It's a statically typed,
   functional reactive language that compiles to JavaScript. As a frontend developer one can choose from a multitude
   of JavaScript (or compile-to-JS) frameworks and libraries that offer a similar featureset. I'm going to give
   a short introduction to the language itself, its development environment and the community to let you think about
   if it could be a viable alternative or addition to your current stack.
