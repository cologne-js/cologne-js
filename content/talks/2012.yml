      title: "Unhosted & Remote Storage – freedom from the web’s monopolies"
      description: "Web apps are a package deal: You use their app, they get your data. With the Unhosted movement we aim to protect people’s privacy, make it easier to run apps and enable you to have your data in one place. This is achieved by separating apps into client-side apps and per-user data storage, for which we define the open Remotestorage standard."

      title: "Introduction to Deferreds and Callbacks"
      description: "Does your code start to look like Christopher Nolan’s Inception? Do you have a hard time following the logic of your own code with callbacks within callbacks within callbacks?

      title: "Accessible JavaScript - a short walkthrough"
      description: "Accessible JavaScript should be in strategic focus from the very first - unfortunately most JavaScript plugins and frameworks don’t. In a short walkthrough we test bad and good examples on accessibility, i.e. if they are usable with keyboard and screenreader. Finally we talk about the use of WAI-ARIA to get JavaScript more accessible."

      title: "SocketStream & Node.js for interactive single page apps"
      description: "SocketStream is as a framework to develop highly interactive single page apps utilizing Websockets (socket.io/sock.js).

      title: "Grunting Grunt for Grunts"
      description: "Nowadays frontend developers have to deal with topics and tools that they’ve never encountered before: unit testing, code linting, minification, code modularization and more.\n\n\
        Those who’ve done it, know that setting everything up and maintaining it is a pain that costs hours of working time.
        But that’s not true anymore: thanks to Grunt, we now have a frontend specific build tool that eliminates most of the hard work.\n\n\
        During this talk we will learn how to setup grunt, learn to use it in a real world project and discover it’s ecosystem of plugins."
